# Project Overview

This project is a modern frontend dashboard built with a strong emphasis on **performance**, **accessibility**, and **responsiveness**, while maintaining a clean and scalable architecture.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** – fast development server and optimized production builds
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Accessibility

Accessibility was intentionally prioritized during development and treated as a core requirement, not an afterthought.

- Full **keyboard navigation** support for all interactive elements
- Proper semantic structure to ensure compatibility with **screen readers**
- Predictable focus behavior and accessible interaction patterns

The UI was carefully implemented to remain usable across different assistive technologies.

## Responsive Design

- Fully responsive across **mobile, tablet, and desktop** devices
- Layouts adapt cleanly without breaking usability or visual hierarchy
- Desktop design integrity preserved while optimizing for smaller screens

## Performance Optimization

- Images optimized using **WebP** instead of PNG to reduce payload size
- Faster load times through optimized asset handling
- Efficient component structure to minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Code Quality

- Strong **TypeScript typing** to reduce runtime errors
- Consistent component patterns for maintainability and scalability
- UI interactions tested to ensure stability across devices and input methods
